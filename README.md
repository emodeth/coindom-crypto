<h2>About the project</h2>

<p><b>Coindom</b> is a website that allows users to search for information about various cryptocurrencies in real-time. The website is designed to provide users with accurate and up-to-date information about the price, market cap, trading volume, and other key metrics of cryptocurrencies. <br/>

This is the version 1. This version doesn't have responsive desing and coin page. Also folder structer is a bit broken but I want to keep this project to see my progress of coding.
